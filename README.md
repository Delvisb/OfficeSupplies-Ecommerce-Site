# OfficeSupplies-Ecommerce-Site
## CSIT 355 Final Project
The semester project will entail the following:  You need to design a website that has e-commerce capabilities for a client.   You will be creating a database front-ended by a website.  You will need to offer at least 30 products that can be categorized into at least 5 categories.  Your website will need to also support minor human resources management for your employees so you can track them properly.  It should also allow users to create accounts for customers and then in the employee area, create employee accounts.
